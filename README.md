# Evaluation of Noise Levels in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Using Apple Watch

Alarms from monitors and medical devices, staff activities, and patient interventions contribute to high noise levels in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and may disrupt sleep patterns in patients admitted to the ICU contributing to the development of delirium and post-intensive care syndrome.

We investigated the feasibility of analysing data from an Apple Watch to measure noise levels in the ICU exporting Health data from an ICU nurse's Apple Watch. Data extraction and statistical analysis were performed with the “Pandas” Python Library inside a Jupyter notebook.
